        Returns an upper bound on the MCA error when applying a random linear combination.
        The coefficients are assumed to be powers here.

        Note: the errors for correlated agreement in the following two cases differ,
        which is related to the batching method:

        Case 1: we batch with randomness r^0, r^1, ..., r^{batch_size-1}
        This is what is called batching over parameterized curves in BCIKS20.
        Here, the error depends on batch_size (called l in BCIKS20), and we find
        the error in Theorem 6.2.

        Case 2: we batch with randomness r_0 = 1, r_1, r_2, r_{batch_size-1}
        This is what is called batching over affine spaces in BCIKS20.
        Here, the error does not depend on batch_size (called l in BCIKS20), and we find
        the error in Theorem 1.6.

        Then easiest way to see the difference is to compare Theorems 1.5 and 1.6.
